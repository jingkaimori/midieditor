Description: Graphical interface to edit, play, and record Midi data.
 ProMidEdit is a free software providing an interface to edit,
 record, and play Midi data.
 .
 The editor is able to open existing Midi files and modify their
 content. New files can be created and the user can enter his own
 composition by either recording Midi data from a connected Midi device
 (e.g., a digital piano or a keyboard) or by manually creating new
 notes and other Midi events. The recorded data can be easily
 quantified and edited afterwards using ProMidEdit.
 .
 ProMidEdit was developed by PROPHESSOR based on Markus Schwenk's MidiEditor. It is entirely written in C++ (Qt 5)
 and is available for the platforms Linux and Windows.
 Support languages: English and Russian
