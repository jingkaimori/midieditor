<h2>Midi - a Short Overview</h2>

<p>
	Midi (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a digital interface allowing
	the user to control virtual music instruments on his computer or on other
	hardware components. In general, the Midi protocol is used to exchange commands
	like &quot;play note X with velocity Y on instrument Z&quot; or similar.
</p>

<p>
	Those commands are usually stored and exchanged using so-called Midi events. They
	can contain information about the notes which are currently played, the sounds
	which belong to each (virtual) instrument, or general information about the song, e.g.
	about the key, the meter, or the song's name. While the above mentioned commands are
	definitely the most often used, there are many other commands, which can e.g. control
	the sustain pedal of a piano or define an instrument's overall volume. The events
	are presented below in more detail.
</p>

<h3 id="tracksandchannels">Tracks and Channels</h3>

<p>
	The different virtual instruments are organized in tracks, where each track refers to
	one instrument or a group of instruments. Hence, each Midi event is assigned to a track.
	Each note will be assigned to the track of the instrument which plays the note,
	while events, which do not belong to a specific instrument (key, meter, etc.), are usually
	assigned to a specific track (&quot;Tempo Track&quot;). Moreover, each note and other
	instrument-specific events are assigned to a channel. There are 16 channels where each
	channel has a defined sound (e.g. &quot;Piano&quot; or &quot;String Ensemble&quot;).
	While it may sound redundant to have each note assigned to a track and a channel, the
	concept makes sense. This is, because the information about the different tracks is only
	known to the device requesting another device to play the note. The other device
	will only receive information about the channel on which to play the note, which reduces
	the traffic needed to exchange the information. Hence, the tracks are (mostly) for
	a user's orientation when editing a file. Usually, all notes within a single track are also
	assigned to one specific channel. However, there are exceptions, e.g. when a group
	of strings is divided into two parts where one part plays pizzicato and the other part
	plays legato; in this case both groups can be noted in the same track but they have
	to use different channels, as each group has another sound.

<h3 id="events">Midi Events</h3>

<p>
	The following list shows the different Midi events and provides an overview of their
	functionality.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<i>Note On/Off Events</i>
		<p>
			Each note is represented by two events, where one event indicates the start
			of a note and the other event is used to stop the note. The note height is represented
			by a number from 0 (C0) to 127 (G10) and the note's velocity (loudness) has
			a range from 0 to 127. The note is assigned to a channel, where the channel's
			configuration specifies the voice of the note.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Tempo Change Events</i>
		<p>
			A Tempo Change Events sets the current tempo. The tempo is set in beats per
			minute (BPM). Higher values indicate a faster tempo.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Time Signature Events</i>
		<p>
			Any meter change is represented by a Time Signature Event in Midi. The event
			holds two parameters, the numerator and the denominator of the meter. E.g.,
			in order to represent an <i>alla breve</i> meter, the numerator would be set
			to 2 and the denominator would be set to half notes.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Key Signature Events</i>
		<p>
			A Key Signature Event defines the song's key (<i>C major</i>, <i>G minor</i>, ...).
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Program Change Events</i>
		<p>
			In order to define the voice (or instrument) assigned to each channel, a
			Program Change Event can be used. E.g., after the program <i>Church Organ</i>
			has been set for channel 5, all notes played on channel 5 will be played
			with an organ's voice.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Control Change Events</i>
		<p>
			Besides the voice assigned to each channel, a lot of other properties
			regarding a channel's sound can be controlled using Control Change Events.
			Up to 128 different controls exist for each channel where a value between
			0 and 127 can be assigned to each control. The available controls include
			the sustain pedal of a piano, the channel's overall volume, and the
			modulation wheel.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Key/Channel Pressure Events</i>
		<p>
			These events control the pressure for each note (Key Pressure Events)
			or for all notes played on a given channel (Channel Pressure Events).
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Pitch Bend Events</i>
		<p>
			The Pitch Bend Events are used to modify the pitch of a given channel.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>Text Events</i>
		<p>
			Lyrics, instrument/tracknames or general information (Copyright etc.) can
			be stored in TextEvents.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<i>System Exclusive Events</i>
		<p>
			System Exclusive Events are used by manufacturers to provide a way
			to send device-specific messages.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="io">Midi I/O</h3>

<p>
 	While synthesizers can easily be installed and run on a computer, a lot
	of hardware exists which can be used to play or record Midi data (e.g.
	digital pianos or hardware synthesizers). Such additional hardware is usually connected
	to the computer using a USB port. Whether or not a synthesizer or a keyboard
	is running on a computer or an additional hardware which is connected to a computer
	does not affect the way how the device is used within a Midi software
	(e.g. MidiEditor). In both cases, a Midi port will be existing for each device
	to allow the software to receive data from or to send data to the device.
