  MidiEditor is a free software providing an interface to edit, record, and play Midi data.
  The editor is able to open existing Midi files and modify their content. New files can
  be created and the user can enter his own composition by either recording Midi data from
  a connected Midi device (e.g., a digital piano or a keyboard) or by manually creating new
  notes and other Midi events. The recorded data can be easily
  quantified and edited afterwards using MidiEditor.

  This manual will provide an overview over the many different features of MidiEditor. However,
  as it would go beyond the scope of this manual to discuss the foundations of Midi,
  only a quick overview will be provided here.

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
	MidiEditor was developed by Markus Schwenk. It is entirely written in C++ (Qt)
	and is available for the platforms Linux and Windows. Should MidiEditor be a software which is helpful
	for you and which you use often, please let the developer and other users know by providing feedback.
	Moreover, the developer worked on MidiEditor in his (rare) sparetime and offers it for free. So,
	when you feel like it, pay him a coffee (or two). Please also feel free to contact the developer
	in case you have any ideas which could help to improve the editor or in the case you found any bugs
	you want the developer to	fix.
